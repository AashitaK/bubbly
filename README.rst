bubbly
******************************

Bubbly is a package for plotting interactive and animated *bubble charts* using *Plotly*. The animated bubble charts can accommodate up to seven variables viz. X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis, time, bubbles, their size and their color in a compact and captivating way. Bubbly is easy to use with plenty of customization, especially suited for use in Jupyter notebooks and is designed to work with ``plotly``'s offline mode such as in Kaggle kernels.
